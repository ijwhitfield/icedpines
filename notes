	have a gigantic dot array
	put a slice in each entity such that when you draw that entity, you also draw the dots in the slice
	adding dots is done by basically reallocing the dot slice from the dot array
	alternatively: just make() a slice of dots as needed, then update the dots when you update the entity, and draw the dots when you draw the entity
