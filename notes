endless runner, upgrades and a "win upgrade" to give the game finality
you're looking at the character from behind as they descend a snowy slope on a snowboard
you stick your hand in the snow to load a snowball, then throw snowballs at obstacles
	sticking your hand into the snow is automatic, not a player action, it just represents the cooldown
when you hit an obstacle, it freezes, and you can slam through it and shatter it
if it's not frozen and you hit it, you take damage
random things appear on the slope, gradually more obstacles *and* more boosts/powerups
powerups should increase the risks you're taking (making you go faster usually)

MVP: you're on a slope, there are boosts that make you faster, there are trees you need to freeze, and you need to hit trees with snowballs to freeze them
